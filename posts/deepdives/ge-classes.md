&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you ever wondered why you are required by your college to take a handful of classes that have seemingly nothing to do with your major? The 101-level Arts, Humanities, and Writing classes that may seem like a waste of time to some were introduced in the 1960s as an innovative approach to educating the public. These general education(GE) classes grew popular and were introduced across the country within undergraduate curricula for degree-seeking students. At the time, students didn’t have a choice as to which specific classes they could take, but today students can choose between over sixty subjects like Anthropology, Environmental Science, Cultural Music, Photography, and more.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GE classes are supplementary to the major-related classes required for your degree. They are often taken within the first two years of your college coursework plan before starting the more in-depth upper-division classes regardless of whether you’re at a four-year university or a community college. Most community college students planning to transfer choose to complete their GE classes while at community college. This is a great way for both to fulfill their specific university’s lower division transfer requirements and to save money. At UCs, mandatory GE classes make up about one-third to one-half of your Bachelor’s degree which is about forty-two to sixty semester-based credits. When credits can cost up to $530 per credit at a UC or $2000 at USC, the alternative of around $46 per credit at a community college starts to look more attractive.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we talk about the different GE checklists you can complete, you should know how to choose those classes in the first place. If you were ever confused about how course numbers, course names, and awarded credit hours are articulated between community colleges and four-year public schools, Assist.org should answer your questions. [ASSIST](http://assist.org "ASSIST") is an official tool used by California’s public schools to outline the required major classes as well as some specific GE classes that each school requires.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, choosing which GE checklist to follow boils down to where you plan to transfer. The Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC) pathway fulfills the requirements for all UCs and most CSUs. There are some nuances with IGETC requirements that must be noted:
- You must complete each class with a letter grade ‘C’ or greater for them to be counted.
- AP Scores may count towards your GE requirements but only if you receive a 3 or higher.
- In [specific circumstances](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/transfer-requirements/general-education-igetc/igetc/ "specific circumstances"), some California community colleges may grant partial certification of IGETC to students who are missing no more than two requirements. However, you must verify that you are eligible for this with your counselor or the admissions office.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below is a table of the IGETC requirements as provided by the UC system. Using it to plan out your coursework for your time at community college will help you avoid equivalent classes and contingency courses in case your desired course fills up. 

**IGETC [Requirements Table](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/transfer-requirements/general-education-igetc/igetc/ "Requirements Table")**

| Subject area  | Required courses  | Units required |
| :------------ |:---------------| :----|
|1. English Communication|2 courses|6 semester units or 8-10 quarter units|
|2. Mathematical Concepts and Quantitative Reasoning|1 course|3 semester units or 4-5 quarter units|
|3. Arts and Humanities |3 courses|9 semester units or 12-15 quarter units|
|4. Social and Behavioral Sciences|3 courses|9 semester units or 12-15 quarter units|
|5. Physical and Biological Sciences|3 courses|7-9 semester units or 9-12 quarter units|
|6. Language Other than English|Proficiency* | Proficiency* |
|Total:|3 courses|34 semester units|


**Proficiency equivalent to two years of high school courses in the same language.*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may also split up your GE coursework between various community colleges if your main college doesn’t offer those courses. Dual-enrollment at community colleges is also a good way to bypass the 21-credit limit for those who need to finish their requirements early.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a contrast,  the CSU GE-Breadth requirements are less extensive than IGETC. This checklist is a great reference if you have your mind set on a specific CSU school and aren’t planning on transferring elsewhere. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These requirements are more flexible for the [following reasons](https://www.sbcc.edu/transfercenter/whichge.php "following reasons"):
- You may complete part of the GE-Breadth pattern after your transfer to the CSU, but whether or not you will be accepted with partial completion would be decided on a case-to-case basis.
- Unlike IGETC, CSU-Breadth can be more forgiving. If you’ve received a letter grade ‘D’ in any of your GEs, it will usually be accepted for most requirements. The exception is your “Area A” classes (A1- Oral Communication, A2 - Written Communication, A3- Critical Thinking) and B4 classes (Mathematics/Quantitative Reasoning).


Below are the CSU-breadth guidelines as provided by the CSU system for upper-division transfers.

| Subject area | Required courses | Units required |

| Area C: Arts and Humanities | C1, C2 | 12 semester units (18 quarter units) |
| Area D: Social Sciences | 2 Disciplines | 9 semester units (12 quarter units) |
| Area E: Lifelong Learning and Self-Development | 1 Discipline | 3 semester units (4 quarter units) |
| Area F: Ethnic Studies | 1 Discipline | 3 semester units (4 quarter units) |

|Requirement ID | Requirement Description |

| A1 | Oral Communication |
| A2 | Written Communication |
| A3 | Critical Thinking |
| B1 | Physical Science |
| B2 | Life Science |
| B3 | Laboratory Science |
| B4 | Mathematics/Quantitative Reasoning |
| C1 | Arts: (e.g., Arts, Cinema, Dance, Music Theater) |
| C2 | Humanities: (e.g., Literature, Philosophy, Languages Other than English) |

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, for those of you who are solely seeking an Associate’s or equivalent degree, your GE classes for your degree are determined by your respective community colleges. We recommend getting in touch with your academic advisors or counselors since every scenario is different.
