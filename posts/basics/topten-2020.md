# 1. Check Rate My Professor.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing to do before choosing your classes is to find the right instructor. Going to community college is one of the smartest financial decisions you can make, but there are drawbacks like any decision. Until you transfer to a UC or CSU, professors are hit or miss. Ratemyprofessors.com is a website where students can view and write reviews about professors on a 5 level difficulty system. You can find detailed descriptions of almost any professor from a CA community college. Some reviews will flat out tell you if a class is an easy A or not, while others require a more in-depth look. Take advantage of special tools, such as overall satisfaction ratings, percentages, and tags.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tags are essentially hashtags and are a quick way to learn what a class entails. If a professor is a harsh grader, they will have a tag for that. If they give extra credit, they will have a tag for that—even personal traits like caring or funny professors are tags. Students can also post what grades they received in their reviews, compare this with the difficulty rating to determine if a class is an easy A. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last thing to know and the most important is how to verify if a review is creditable. All students can like or dislike a review, a positive like to dislike ratio is an indicator that other students agree with a review. If the ratio is negative, some students may think the reviewer is bogus. A review is always biased towards the reviewer’s experience. Some students may have had a bad experience because of poor study habits, language barriers, attitudes, or any number of reasons. A good review is one that has been approved by the larger community of students.


# 2. Learn to self-study.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you find a great professor, there's a chance that class may already be full. Bad professors are an experience you can’t avoid, and it is better to be prepared. Studying independently and studying early are two tricks every college student should pick up. You can’t always rely on lectures either; reading the textbook is your greatest resource when stuck with a bad professor. Even with a highly rated professor, reading early is a good habit to make. You’ll be prepared for exams and can devote more time to activities outside the classroom. Your GPA will reflect this, improving your chances of transferring to the school of your dreams. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If your school is on a quarter system, self-study is your lifeline to success. Procrastination may have been fun or even quirky in high school, but your grade will suffer when midterms are every three to five weeks. Better to be aware of it and break those habits as quickly as possible. 


# 3. Don’t expect counselors to have the answers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is the truth: you’re on your own now, and most counselors won’t be able to help you. The transfer process is intimidating to everyone, and our first thought is to speak with a guidance counselor. However, 9/10 times, counselors will simply read your major requirements off of Assist. Assist.org is a great resource, but you don’t need to make an appointment to find that out.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assist is simply a database that compiles all UC and CSU transfer agreements for every given year. It has an easy interface that allows you to see everything from what majors are transferable to the exact classes needed to transfer. Here’s a secret your counselor may neglect to share: the most recent year’s agreements are not as comprehensive as the ones from 2-3 years ago. Looking at an agreement from a few years early will sometimes show you optional major pathways and are more detailed in general. Later agreements may also have new requirements so it is important to compare the two when drafting your edplan. 


# 4. Have a plan for transfer.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The traditional transfer route is two years at a community college, then two years at a university. Because UC applications open in fall and Common App follows in winter, the first year of community college is the time where everything matters. Universities can only see grades from the time before you apply. We recommend declaring a major and completing your undergraduate as quickly as possible. Admissions offices recognize A’s in major classes over all other classes; don’t let that grade go to waste by taking important classes after you apply.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of your major, certain GE’s also need to be taken before transfer. Degree Works allows you to make an education plan with specific course IDs and their credit counts. Drafting an ed plan either on Degree Works or with a counselor is also crucial to obtaining priority registration. You don’t have to follow this plan strictly, but you should know the classes you need to complete before transferring.

# 5. Promised Program and Other Scholarship Opportunities.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One incredible benefit of going to a California Community College is the cost of tuition is free for your first two years of schooling. The Promise program is a scholarship all first-time college students are eligible for. The only requirement is that you maintain a minimum of 12 credits per quarter or 8 credits per semester. Recipients of the Promise program receive full financial aid for classes. Recipients also receive $500 a year to be spent on supplies, textbooks, and other resources available for purchase at your campus bookstore.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A downside of the program is that financial aid only covers the first two years of college. Besides, you must be a full-time student. It’s primarily meant for students looking to transfer in their junior year. It’s not impossible to balance classes with a part-time or full-time job, but if you’re planning on doing so, be aware of how you manage your time. This is where having an ed plan and reliable study habits will help you out tremendously. There is also a range of other financial aid scholarships provided by CA colleges and charitable organizations. You can find out more information about scholarships on your college’s website.


# 6. Pick times over teachers (Especially for TAG) 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are enrolling in a California Community College, there is a good chance that you are planning to transfer out through the TAG or a similar program. If this is the case, it is important to prioritize the timing of your classes. Follow your transfer plan as best as possible, and don’t delay taking a class because of bad professors. It sucks when a highly rated professor’s class is full, but it’s also inevitable. If you’ve learned to self-study and study early, you shouldn’t fear that professor from hell. What’s important is finishing the classes you need before applications are due.

# 7. Online GEs:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Community College isn’t easy. Whether you’re working a part-time job or taking care of a family member, it can be difficult to find time to take the classes you need for an associate’s degree and/or transfer. Online classes allow ease of schedule and open notes. Plenty of CA Community College courses can be taken online as well as in person. If you developed reliable study habits going online might be the way to go.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many online GE’s are easy A’s and will boost your GPA significantly. Going online is not a guarantee you'll always learn something though. Consider what you want to take away from your major and GE classes. You may be a student who learns more effectively in person. We advise taking one or two classes in-person to help maintain a sense of schedule. Major classes will only get harder after you transfer and it's important to be prepared long term. Keep in mind admissions offices cannot see if a class was taken in person or online. To them, an A is an A. 


# 8. Activities (be involved) 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you, like many of us, coasted through high school expecting responsibility to come later, then now is the time to get involved. Don’t listen to what people tell you; CC is not high school 2.0. A solid list of activities will improve your application and catch the eyes of admission officers. Number one: take on a leadership role. Universities, especially UCs, love seeing students who can lead and take charge. Join a club or start a passion project. Don’t be afraid to do something big or small; failure is a learning experience and a great essay topic. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not every activity has to be a leadership role; admission offices also just wanna know you’re keeping busy. Getting a part-time job or volunteering are great experiences to round out your application. Doing so will emphasize how well you can balance responsibilities and prepare for life at a university. 


# 9. Maintaining priority registration:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To stay on track and take the classes you need, making sure you have an early priority registration date is a necessity. Most schools allow you to sign up for classes around the end of the quarter/semester. Most colleges divide students' registration into groups based on academic special needs, veteran status, athleticism, and past enrollment in that order. Additional information and dates can be found at your college’s website and/or portal under its academic calendar. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very important note: for community colleges your priority status will be dropped entirely if you take a quarter/semester off and you may have to reapply to the school. This is why maintaining 12 quarter or 8-semester credits are crucial to remaining a full-time student. Schools also award higher priority eligibility after you create an edplan on Degree Works. If you’re concerned about losing priority registration for special needs or veteran status, your campus should have offices dedicated to assisting you. 


# 10. Mental Health
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The list of things to do is long, and if you’re just starting out you’re most likely already overwhelmed. The last thing to know, which should be the first thing you do, is to breathe. Regardless if you’re attending a four year or CC, academia and mental health go hand in hand. It’s important to regularly check-in and be honest with yourself. Plan your weeks out accordingly so that you have ample time for rest, exercise, and friends. You’re not alone.
