## 1. Check Rate My Professor:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing to do before choosing your classes is to find the right instructor. Going to community college is one of the smartest financial decisions you can make, but there are drawbacks like any other decision. Until you transfer to a University of California(UC) or California State University(CSU), professors are hit or miss. Ratemyprofessors.com is where students can view and write reviews about professors on a five-level difficulty system. You can find detailed descriptions of almost any professor from a California community college. Some reviews will flat out tell you if a class is an easy A or not, while others require a more in-depth look. Take advantage of special tools, such as overall satisfaction ratings, percentages, and tags.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tags are essentially hashtags and are a quick way to learn what a class entails. If a professor is a harsh grader, they will have a tag for that. If they give extra credit, they will have a tag for that. Even personality traits, like caring or funny, are tags. Students can also post what grades they received in their reviews, and you can compare this with the difficulty rating to determine how you might do in a class.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last and most important thing to know is how to verify if a review is credible. All students can like or dislike a review, a positive like to dislike ratio is an indicator that other students agree with a review. If the ratio is negative, some students may think the reviewer is bogus. A review is always biased towards the reviewer’s experience. Some students may have had a bad experience because of poor study habits, language barriers, attitudes, or any number of reasons. A dependable review will align with the opinions of the larger community of students.

## 2. Learn to self-study:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you find a great professor, there's a chance that the class may already be full. Bad professors are an experience you can’t avoid, and it is better to be prepared. Studying independently and studying early are two tricks every college student should pick up. You can’t always rely on lecture materials either; reading the textbook is your greatest resource when stuck with a bad professor. Even with a highly rated professor, reading ahead is a good habit to make. You will be prepared for exams and can devote more time to activities outside the classroom. As a result, your GPA will reflect that you have strong and consistent study habits, improving your chances of transferring to the school of your dreams.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If your school is on a quarter system, self-study is your lifeline to success. Procrastination may have come easy in high school, but be aware that turning in assignments late will negatively impact your learning a lot more when midterms are every three to five weeks. Wherever you transfer to, your upper-division courses will be much more challenging. Recognize what bad study habits you have now, and break them as quickly as possible.

## 3. Pick times over teachers (Especially for TAG):
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are enrolling in a California Community College, there is a good chance that you are planning to transfer out through a program like Transfer Admission Guarantee(TAG). If this is the case, it is important to prioritize the timing of your classes. Follow your transfer plan as best as possible, and do not delay taking a class because of bad professors. It sucks when a highly rated professor’s class is full, but it’s also inevitable. If you’ve learned to self-study and study early, you shouldn’t fear professors with bad reputations. What’s important is finishing the classes you need before applications are due.

## 4. Have a plan for transfer:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The traditional transfer route is two years at a community college, then two years at a university. Because UC applications open in the fall and Common App follows in the winter, the first year of community college is the time when grades matter most. Universities can only see grades from the time before you apply. We recommend declaring a major and completing your lower-division courses as quickly as possible. Admissions offices recognize A’s in major classes over all other courses; do not let that grade go to waste by taking important classes after applying. Furthermore, completing lower-division requirements before you transfer informs universities of your readiness to succeed in their undergraduate programs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of your major, certain GEs also need to be taken before transfer. Degree Works allows you to make an education plan with specific course IDs and their credit counts. Drafting an ed plan either on Degree Works or with a counselor is also crucial to obtaining priority registration. You do not have to follow this plan strictly, but you should know the classes you need to complete before transferring.

## 5. Don’t expect academic counselors to have all of the answers:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Academic general counselors at your community college may be a hit or a miss. The transfer process is intimidating to everyone, and our first thought is to speak with a guidance counselor. However, based on our experience, these counselors have minimal resources and sometimes simply read your major requirements off of ASSIST. Assist.org is a great resource, but you do not need to make an appointment with a counselor to use it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assist is simply a database that compiles all UC and CSU transfer agreements for every given year. It has an easy interface that allows you to see everything from what majors are transferable to the exact classes needed to transfer. Here’s a secret your counselor may neglect to share: the most recent year’s agreements are not as comprehensive as the ones from 2-3 years ago. Looking at an agreement from a few years early will sometimes show optional major pathways and are more detailed in general. Later agreements may also have new requirements, so it is essential to compare the two when drafting your Ed Plan.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best source to rely on for information about transferring are students who have already transferred. Large online communities of current and former community college students exist, dedicated to helping each other succeed. Your peers are your greatest resource for choosing professors and learning information about certain classes. Alumni can also counsel you on what admissions offices look for in transfer applicants based on their own experiences.

## 6. Promised Program and Other Scholarship Opportunities:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One incredible benefit of going to a California Community College is free tuition for your first two years of schooling. The Promise program is a scholarship all first-time college students are eligible for; the only requirement is that you maintain a minimum of twelve credits per quarter or eight credits per semester. Recipients of the Promise program receive full financial aid for classes. Recipients also receive $500 a year to be spent on supplies, textbooks, and other resources available for purchase at your campus bookstore.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A downside of the program is that financial aid only covers the first two years of college. Also, you must be a full-time student. It’s primarily meant for students looking to transfer in their junior year. It’s not impossible to balance classes with a part-time or full-time job, but if you’re planning on doing so, be aware of how you manage your time. This is where having an ed plan and reliable study habits will help you out tremendously. There is also a range of other financial aid scholarships provided by California colleges and charitable organizations. You can find out more information about scholarships on your college’s website.

## 7. Online General Education(GE) Classes:
![](https://images2.imgbox.com/d8/0a/eL8Qa3Rh_o.png)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Community College is not easy. Whether you’re working a part-time job or taking care of a family member, it can be challenging to find time to take the classes you need for an associate’s degree and/or transfer. Online courses allow ease of schedule and open notes. Plenty of California Community College courses can be taken online as well as in person. If you have developed reliable study habits, then going online might be the way to go.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many online GE’s are easy A’s and will boost your GPA significantly. Although going online is not a guarantee, you will always learn something. Consider what you want to take away from your major and GE classes. You may be a student who learns more effectively in person. We advise taking one or two classes in-person to help maintain a sense of schedule. Major classes will only get harder after you transfer, and it's important to be prepared long term. Keep in mind admissions offices cannot see if a class was taken in person or online. To them, an A is an A.

## 8. Activities (Be involved):
![](https://images2.imgbox.com/d4/d6/rMZBkwXu_o.png)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you, like many of us, coasted through high school expecting responsibility to come later, then now is the time to get involved. Do not listen to what people tell you; community college is not high school 2.0. A solid list of activities will improve your application and catch the eyes of admission officers. Number one: take on a leadership role. Universities, especially UCs, love seeing students who can lead and take charge. Join a club or start a passion project. Do not be afraid to do something big or small; failure is a learning experience and a great essay topic.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not every activity has to be a leadership role. Admission offices also want to know you’re keeping busy. Getting a part-time job or volunteering are great experiences to round out your application. Doing so will emphasize how well you can balance responsibilities and prepare for life at a university.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you’re interested in applying to private schools, we suggest building relationships with professors. Many private schools require letters of recommendation, and some include them as an option. Several community colleges employ professors with Ph.D.’s and other reputable degrees. Don’t be afraid to start a correspondence with them after class. Consider becoming a teaching assistant or starting practice/study sessions with them. Making a strong academic impression will go a long way in your college acceptance. 

## 9. Maintaining Priority Registration:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To stay on track and take the classes you need, having an early priority registration date/ time is essential. Most schools allow you to sign up for classes towards the end of the quarter/semester. Most colleges divide students' registration into groups based on special academic needs, veteran status, athleticism, and past enrollment in that order. Additional information and dates can be found at your college’s website and/or portal under its academic calendar.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is crucial to note that your priority status for community colleges will be dropped if you take a quarter/semester off, and you may have to reapply to the school. This is why maintaining twelve quarter, or eight-semester credits is crucial to remaining a full-time student. Schools also award higher priority eligibility after you create an Ed Plan on Degree Works. Maintaining the minimum credits required per term and having an Ed Plan guarantees you past enrollment priority registration. Past enrollment makes up the largest registration group and is divided up into subgroups based on seniority. The more terms you attend at a college, the greater your seniority. If you’re concerned about losing or you think you qualify for priority registration based on special needs or veteran status, your campus should have offices dedicated to assisting you.

## 10. Mental Health:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The list of things to do is long, and if you’re just starting, you’re most likely already overwhelmed. The first thing you should do is to breathe. Regardless of you’re attending a four-year institution or community college, academia and mental health go hand in hand. It’s important to regularly check-in and be honest with yourself. Plan your weeks out accordingly so that you have ample time for rest, exercise, and friends. If you find yourself struggling, contact your college’s administration zbout mental health services.
