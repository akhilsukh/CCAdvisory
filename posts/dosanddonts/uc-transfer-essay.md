One of the main stressors for us during UC college applications were the insight questions. Written well, they can make up for a poor grade and put your application over the top, poorly written, they could weigh your application down, making it forgettable in the sea of other applications. The UC insight questions are your one shot of sharing your unique strengths and adding a personality to the grades and test scores on your application. That’s why we’ve compiled a list of do’s and don’ts to help you better your essays and improve your odds of transferring to your dream UC.

## Do’s

#### Get Started Early

The UC application prompts are generally identical from year to year. The last major update was in 2016 when they switched from two long essays to four short essays. This means they probably won’t be changing much going forward, and you can find the writing prompts from earlier years to start writing as early as you’d like. Brainstorming and starting drafts over the summer is a good way to have some leeway in case of unexpected scenarios and a solid plan-of-action as you head into fall term. 

#### Stick To Theme

A great way to find an essay topic is to make a list of major life events and memorable moments that are essential to understanding you, then find common patterns and themes within the list. Once you’ve found your theme, stick to it. It’s easy to go off track when you’re trying to tell a story but don’t have a central theme. 

#### Peer Review

Have you ever read or said a word so many times, that it starts to lose meaning and sound strange? The same can happen if you keep rereading your own essays. Instead find some friends (with no conflict of interest) and ask them to read your essays before and after major changes. That being said, you should make your creative decisions yourself and not overly depend on others, lest it starts sounding like someone else's work. Fresh eyes also help to spot any context errors, where you forget that the reader doesn’t personally know you. 

## Don’ts

#### Write to a Work Count

While 350 words is your word limit, it’s not a requirement. Don’t feel pressured to tack on words to make your essay longer. An essay that drags on is not fun to read, and may result in the reader just skimming the rest of your essay. Try to be clear and concise; If you can get the point across in less than 350 words, then that’s great. Remember the KISS rule: Keep It Simple, Stupid.

#### Write About Stats

You only have a combined 1400 words to write what makes you different from the tens of thousands of other applicants. Don’t waste it on repeating stats like grades or test scores that are already included in your application, unless you have a meaningful story behind those achievements. 

#### Try to Play the System

Admission officers read essays for a living. You don’t have to make up some story about some heroic deed you’ve accomplished, because they will see right through that. Instead, dig deeper and write about something impactful and original, even if you think it’s less impressive. Remember, admission officers have more experience reading college essays than you do writing college essays.

#### Read Your Essays after Submission

When you’re done submitting your UC Application, take a deep breath and pat yourself on the back. Now, let it go and wait till January to submit your TAU (Transfer Agreement Update). Rereading your essays is a sure-shot way to finding small mistakes and get anxious. If it’s a grammatical or spelling mistake, then you’ll be fine. In fact, chances are they won’t catch it on their first read. Whether or not you get the results you were looking for, remember that you gave it your all.
