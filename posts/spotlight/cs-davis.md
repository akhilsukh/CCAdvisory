&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;California has become the center of the technological world. Trillion-dollar companies, like Apple and Google, all started from humble beginnings in the Bay Area. It only makes sense that the UC system would expand its computer science departments to capitalize on the growing industry. Since it began in the 1960s, computer science has become one of the most competitive majors, accepting only a few thousand transfer applicants a year.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the opportunity to sit down with Alex Nguyen, a Computer Science major attending UC Davis. Alex gave me the rundown on what it is like to be one of a few hundred transfer students admitted to Davis Computer science. In our interview, we discussed coursework, the different transfer pathways you can pursue, and the level of commitment needed to succeed during and after college.

## UC Transfer Requirements

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computer science can be a very customizable degree if you pursue the right courses and work hard. With it, you can assume various roles such as a software engineer, web developer, program manager, and many others. Naturally, what you pursue and the skills you obtain will open up lucrative job opportunities after college.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your future in mind, it is essential you make an Ed Plan early. Every UC has specific lower-division course requirements needed to transfer. For most majors, those requirements are the same at every UC campus. However, Computer Science is a niche major, and different UCs require different programming languages. UC Irvine requires the Python coding series, UC Santa Cruz requires Java, and Davis requires C++, to name a few.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the computer language requirement, every UC requires a minimum math requirement of Calculus 1A through 1C and a specific science series. Alex told me there is a big misconception that all UCs specifically need Physics as a science. While most UCs require the Physics series, he said Davis lets you choose between Biology, Chemistry, and Physics. You’ll still have to take a full year of science, but Alex thinks Davis’s lower-division courses are the most flexible out of any of the UCs.

## Why UC Davis?

The big question I had for Alex was, why Davis?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alex got accepted into UC San Diego’s Data Science program and had a plan to switch majors, but he said Davis was the more time-efficient option for transferring. San Diego is ranked sixteenth in computer science nationally; compare that to Davis, ranked thirty-seventh, and Alex must have a good reason for choosing the latter.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said Davis was the only UC to provide all lower-division courses at his community college. In the tech field, he said, “it’s do or die for Computer Science Majors,” now that he only has a few remaining upper-division courses to complete, Alex is free to pursue several internships. After consulting Davis alumni employed by Microsoft, Alex confirmed employers value all the UC’s Computer Science programs as equal in prestige, and your internship experience is what lands you a job after college. He said interning during your junior and senior year is crucial for transfer students like him who spend their first two years of college grinding.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that separates Davis from San Diego and the other UCs is the different networking opportunities each campus offers. Big tech companies recruit out of UC job fairs, Intel, Twitter, and LinkedIn specifically all recruit out of Davis based on Alex’s experience. Coupled with Davis’s undergraduate program’s flexibility, and it is clear Alex made a reasonable decision.

### Alex’s Decision was Impacted By TAG

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2019 the average GPA for non-TAG Computer Science majors admitted to Davis was 3.8, and only 20% were accepted. Comparatively, Davis TAG only requires an overall 3.2 GPA and a selective 3.4 GPA in your calculus classes. On top of that, Davis TAG has NO science requirement, meaning you can opt-out of an entire series of courses if you solely choose to TAG. However, putting all your eggs in one basket is risky, and we recommend you pursue multiple transfer pathways as a backup. Nonetheless, Alex said the difference in TAG vs. non-TAG requirements was a colossal destresser for him.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is worth mentioning Davis, Riverside, and Santa Cruz are the only UCs that still offer TAG for Computer Science majors. Beginning Fall 2022, Davis TAG will require an overall and selective 3.5 GPA.


### What’s the Grind like for Computer Science majors?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alex’s first word of advice for any student beginning a coding language is to “master the fundamentals in your beginner classes.” Alex went into his beginner C++ class feeling prepared because he had experience coding in his high school Java class and felt comfortable using tools like Microsoft Visual Studio. You can also self-study using YouTube, Udemy/Udacity, Textbooks, and Bootcamps. Alex said he wishes he took the Beginner + Intermediate course instead because every Beginner coding class can be a “slow-paced drag” for non-novices. He noted many students trail behind in their Beginner coding classes because they go in completely blank. Perfecting your coding skills early on is essential for success in subsequent coding classes.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's important to note that it is not super important which language you start with because the principles are the same. As mentioned before, different UCs require different coding series, so verify your college’s assist requirements at the beginning of your freshman year. Furthermore, employers don’t value one language over others when hiring. Being well versed in C++ vs. Python does not dictate what role you may pursue in the tech industry.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intermediate and Advanced classes are a majority project-based - around eight to ten coding projects per term based on Alex’s experience. He strongly encourages students to pair up with others who share the same relative skill-level for group projects. Piggybacking on more experienced students only hurts your chances of getting an ‘A’ because the gap between students’ skill levels makes it more difficult for them to challenge each other. Coding is a very time-consuming and grueling process.

*“The number one skill to have if you’re planning on being a CS major is persistence. You will run into countless errors on every assignment that will make you want to quit, and you will be tested by the number of problems you can solve without breaking.”*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Separate from coding projects are midterms and final exams. Your exams’ format widely varies between professors, but they typically make up the largest percentage of your grade. Some professors also administer weekly or biweekly short quizzes that are mostly definition-based, i.e., multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank. All exams are conceptual-based and assess how you troubleshoot problems coding.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding the right professor might be the most critical step for any Computer Science major other than learning to code. Alex said, “if their syllabus or the structure of their assignments is unclear, then you should drop the class immediately.” You can try asking the professor for help, but if their assignments don’t make sense in the first week, It is unlikely they will later in the term. You’re better off switching professors while you can or waiting until next term to find one whose class is structured more clearly. If however, you’ve planned on taking the class during a specific term and are unable to make changes to your plan, then prepare by self-studying extensively. It’s important to preserve when dropping isn’t an option.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alex attributes much of his success to his school’s subreddit. A vast online community of former and current transfer students exists, all eager to help you. There is almost always someone who can share information about professors or tell you about a specific class. Ask other students to determine if your school has a subreddit, Facebook page, or a Discord. If your school has no online community, help get one started and support your fellow students. The only way we progress is by helping each other.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing to remember when meeting with your community college’s general counselorsis that they often have the same resources as you do. If you need a counselor, Alex suggests going straight to the UCs and contacting Davis’s Computer Science Department. A well-funded staff of specialized councilors works there to help students like you transfer. He concluded the interview with some final words of advice.

*“Don’t compare yourself to others. Nine times out of ten, you’re not going to be the smartest kid in the class, and that’s okay. Understanding that fact is the most challenging thing for Computer Science majors to cope with. No one who starts coding is a masterful prospect; it’s important to build off your failures.”*
